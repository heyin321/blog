However, this will require that you be creative and use everything at your fingertips to create the strongest password possible for a secure web site.</p> <p>Tip #1 - Use All Spaces</p> <p>No matter how many characters are available for your password you should be sure to use every one of them. The more characters available for your password and the more you use makes it that much harder to figure out the combination. Always make use of all characters available for a strong and secure password.</p> <p>Tip #2 - Obscure not Obvious</p> <p>Personal information such as names, birthdays, nicknames, pet's names, social security numbers, and the like should never, ever, ever be used because these are way too obvious and too easy to crack. The more you avoid using things like this as your passwords, the more secure your login areas will be.</p> <p>Tip #3 - Non-Alphabet</p> <p>Never use just the alphabet to create your password. If you include numbers, hyphens, dashes, and other symbols or characters, you will have a more secure password which is increasingly harder to crack with every different symbol or number you add.</p> <p>Tip #4 - Don't Write Your Password</p> <p>This tip you should already know, but once you have created your super secure password to protect your website, commit it to memory, never share it with anyone, and never, ever write it down. No matter how secure you think the location is, if you write the password down you are decreasing the security of your website.</p> <p>Tip #5 - Case</p> <p>Also, make sure you use upper case as well as lowercase in your password if the password is case sensitive. This will add even more variables to your password that will increase security.</p> <p>Tip #6 - Create a Word</p> <p>You do not have to use a word that already exists, you can actually create your own word with a mixture of numbers, cases, and symbols and before you know it you will have a secure password that nobody can crack!</p> <p>Tip #7 - Multiple Passwords</p> <p>As tempting as it might be to use only one password for all of your web sites logins you should never ever do this. To maintain security at all website logins you should create a special system for creating passwords on different sites and stick to that system. This way, you'll always know the passwords but they will differ from site to site.</p> <p>Tip #8 - Logout</p> <p>Always logout! For some reason people think when they have finished their Business they can just continue on about the Internet without logging out. This decreases your security level and if you are logged in anyone can access your account. Because of this you should always logout.</p> <p>Tip #9 - Close the Browser</p> <p>TO be even more sure that your password and personal information are protected you should always close your browser. This is the safest practice and one you should always engage in.</p> <p>Tip #10 - Manage Your Passwords</p> <p>If you have problems managing all of your passwords or remembering them, consider using a password manager. This will help you keep your login information safe and secure without having to remember all of the difficult passwords you created.</p> <p>Michael Turner shows you exactly how to increase web site traffic in his free 7 part mini-series.

Unfortunately there are many forms of scams but in this article we will look at three of the most prominent.</p> <p>419 fraud or &quot;Nigerian Scams&quot;</p> <p>Also known as advanced fee fraud (AFF), 4-1-9 scams are named after the section of the Nigerian penal code that deals with fraud. Although originally originating in Nigeria these scams can originate from anywhere. If you fall for one of these at best you will lose thousands of dollars; at worst you will lose your life. These usually start with an email from a bank official or the relative of a recently deceased African president or a government minister informing you that they have access to millions of dollars but need your help to get the money out of the country. The end result is that when the deal is threatened you will be asked for money to secure the release of the funds. Do not under any circumstances reply to these letters, people have been murdered while following up with these scams.</p> <p>Phishing</p> <p>Phishing scams can be very elaborate, scammers send out emails to millions of internet addresses purporting to be from a financial institution, and requiring you to log in and confirm your details. The email looks authentic and contains a link that you need to click. If you happen to have an account at the bank featured in the scam then it's a very natural thing to click the link and login to &quot;your&quot; account except it's not your account or even your bank. It will be a website setup by the scammers to extract as much information from you as possible, Name, Address Credit card details, Bank login, Password, PIN number etc. Once they have these details it is very likely that will have access to your funds and in the worse case your identity. Avoid these scams by never clicking on a link in an email like these, Banks do not sent out emails requesting you login and confirm your details.</p> <p>Vehicle sales Fraud</p> <p>If you place an advert online to sell a car, boat, or motorcycle you will probably receive one of these scam attempts. You will receive an email from abroad saying that they would like to buy your vehicle and arrange shipping. Once you agree you will get a check or bankers draft in the mail within a few days for the amount you asked for the vehicle PLUS the shipping fee you will then be asked to contact the shipper and pay him the extra amount. If you are sensible you will wait for the check to clear then pass on the shipping fee. This is what the scammers expect, the check will only bounce about 3 weeks to a month later at which point your bank will take back the money leaving you short of the shipping money. The best way of avoiding this fraud is not to sell your vehicle to someone who wants to pay the shipper.</p> <p>I hope all this hasn't scared you away from the Internet, If you are sensible and wary about offers that seem too good to be true then you should be Ok, just apply the same commonsense you use in everyday life, after all if a stranger walked up to you in the street and said &quot;Hi I am from your bank what's your credit card number and PIN&quot; would you give it to them?</p> <p>Mark Thompson ran an IT consultancy in London for many years .

The APWG also claims that these email scams steal close to $1 billion a year from its victims.</p> <p>Phishing (pronounced Fishing), is online identity theft that uses spoof emails, fraudulent websites and crimeware to trick unsuspecting internet users into providing financial data, credit card numbers, social security numbers, account logins and passwords, etc.</p> <p>These email scams (spoof email) mimic legitimate companies such as banks, credit card companies, investing companies, paypal, ebay, etc. These fraudulent emails look like they are from the &quot;real&quot; company; many even include the real company's logo. Generally these emails try to convey a sense of urgency; if you don't correct this problem your account will be suspended.</p> <p>The spoof email may state that there is a problem with your account and if you do not log in and update your information your account may be suspended, restricted, terminated, or something similar. They may also request user name, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.</p> <p>Protecting yourself against phishing and email scams.1. Do not give out personal or financial information through an email request.
2. Always log on to your sensitive accounts by opening a new browser and typing the actual URL directly into the address bar. For example, if you receive a suspected phishing email from ebay, open a new browser and type &quot;www.ebay.com&quot; in the browser bar.
3. Do not click on any link in a suspected phishing email.
4. Do not open any attachments in a suspected email scam.
5. Only use a secure website to submit sensitive data. A secure sites' address will begin with https:// instead of http://
6. Check the activity of your online accounts regularly and check for fraudulent activity.
7. Make sure your browser is up to date and all security patches are installed.
8. Report phishing and spoof email to: reportphishing@antiphishing.com , spam@uce.gov, and forward the email to the company that is being spoofed.
9. Keep your PC protected with updated anti-virus software, anti-spyware software, and a firewall.
10. You may want to install an anti-phishing toolbar such as Earthlink ScamBlocker which alerts you before you visit a known fraudulent website. It's free and can be downloaded at http://www.earthlink.net/earthlinktoolbar</p> <p>As email scams are on the rise and with the consequences being identity theft, it is important that you increase your awareness and learn to protect yourself from these fraudulent attacks. With more than 75 million phishing emails being sent every day it's only a matter of time before you receive one. By following the above tips you will protect yourself from many email scams and the possible financial consequences.</p> <p>Lisa Smith makes it easy to increase your online privacy in her newest book, &quot;Internet Safety Tips &amp; Resource Guide.

Unfortunately some dishonest people are using the Popularity of Paypal to line their own pockets with gold at the expense of unsuspecting Pay Pal members. These paypal Scam Artists will try to get your Paypal ID and password so they can Login then Clean out your Paypal Account of all funds. Paypal is fully aware of this problem and is doing everything possible to stop this. Unfortunately if someone logs into an account with a valid Id and Password it is very hard for Paypal or any other secure site for that matter to stop it. As a Consumer you need to be educated so you can protect yourself.</p> <p>A Typical Paypal Scam Artist will send you an e-mail requesting that you update your account. Often this request to update your account is made under some false pretence like it is suspended or has been suspected of Fraudulent use.

Even if it says Paypal in it somewhere it is a Fake Link. The term &quot;https&quot; should always precede any website address where you enter personal information. The &quot;s&quot; stands for secure. If you don't see &quot;https,&quot; you're not in a secure web session, and you should not enter data.(This goes for any payment Processor including your online Bank Accounts)</p> <p>3 - Subject Lines</p> <p>Subject like Please Restore Your Account Access.</p> <p>4 - Generic greetings</p> <p>Lot's of emails begin with a Greeting, such as: &quot;Dear PayPal member. Paypal knows the name you used when you registered your account</p> <p>5 - Action Required Now</p> <p>Many Fake emails try to trick you with the threat that your account is in jeopardy if you don't sign in and fix it NOW!</p> <p>6 - HTML Emails</p> <p>Emails that appear to be websites.

PayPal never asks for personal information in an e-mail.</p> <ol start="7"><li>Misspellings and bad grammar</li></ol> <p>Fake emails may contain misspellings, incorrect grammar, missing words.

You've been scouring the web for that perfect present for your Aunt Bess in Idaho. You finally find it at presents4aunties.com. The site looks a little rough on the edges, weird colors and such. But they have that gift you know will make Aunt Bess add you to her will. You purchase the gift, log off and head to bed. Tired but happy.</p> <p>The next day, Coffee in hand, you turn on your computer. That's strange you say, it's awfully slow this morning. Finally it's booted and ready to go. You open your browser to check the Cow Tipping Blog for the latest posts. What's this you say, My Homepage is now longer the Blog, but a site trying to sell me a DVD of the Smurfs vs. the Terminator! Oh well you say, not quite fully awake. You type in the URL for your Blog and wait. And wait, and wait. Finally it's up! You start to read the mornings postings. You're into the second post about the upcoming Cow Tipping Championship in Vegas when a Popup appears and says you need to go to heartburngone.com for the new revolutionary cure for heartburn. Click here now it says and receive a free gift, the secret cure for Baldness! Weird you think, you click the X to close it. You don't realize by clicking the X that a small hidden piece of code has just been downloaded to your computer. You finish the blog postings and decide to check your Bank Account. You type in the URL and wait, and wait. Finally the Bank Logon appears. You log in, completely unaware of the code, which is actually a Keylogger, is recording your every keystroke. The Transaction is there for Aunties gift, you're so happy. You log off and remember you forgot to email that document for your Boss. That's ok you say, I can log in from here and send it! Technology is so great ! You log into your work portal and access your email program, find the document, attach it to the email form and send it. You vaguely remember it had something to do with the updated personal info list for all of the employees at your job. It includes their Addresses, email addresses and Direct Deposit Account numbers, also their Logon Names and Passwords to access the Computers at work. Darn you say as another Popup appears, what's wrong with this computer?</p> <p>Well at least you didn't forget the Bosses Document. Wouldn't want to get in trouble with the Boss. You've a great job, working for the Trans Global Bank after all. Offices all over the world don't you know. Well time to check your Anti-Virus program for updates. Hmmm it says no updates kneeded. You notice the miss-spelling but what the heck, those things happen. Geez the computer is really slow! You decide to reboot, hoping that will fix it. Gripes, now it won't even boot! At least there's a little extra money in the ole Bank Account to get it fixed. The above is fiction. No animals were harmed. But it's scary huh to think it could happen. Granted it's a worse case scenario, but I wonder...</p> <p>Be smart out there people, learn how to use your Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware programs. Keep them updated, and it they don't work well for your surfing habits, find programs that will.

Who are these companies and how do they get away with it? They are costing computer users millions with their sneakware system of promotional crap!</p> <p>We have some serious problems. These narcissistic bugger programmers that develop application and browser hijackers, pop-up pushers, adware scams and other bogus blots of code that only make life worse, need to be taught a lesson or two. They are like fleas, pesky taggers, used gum thrown on the pavement that you just stepped in, but way worse. And for what reason? advertising?</p> <p>The graffiti artist or &quot;tagger&quot; is trying to make a name for himself by either creative representation or pure mass distribution. Hey, you are all annoying, you are all vandals, but really, your destruction is trite. We are not afraid of you we just think your art is ugly.</p> <p>Of course you can get some bug spray or clean your shoe, but these hijacks will cost you a whole lot more. Oh yeah, I have seen massive amounts of destruction brought about by malicious code, and I am not talking about viruses.</p> <p>Let's Reason</p> <p>Truthfully, I think we need to intervene and get a hold of this situation. There are companies that produce &quot;hijackers&quot; for the sake of advertising. But that code has grown far too chaotic to serve as any means for honest advertising. I am hired every day to fix problems brought about by certain American corporate advertising campaigns.</p> <p>Most of us have experienced the various &quot;Trojans&quot; that hijack your Internet browser start and search pages, changing them to some site that they are advertising for, let alone the formidable &quot;about.blank&quot; page. The Trojan then makes it difficult to change these setting back, often requiring Registry edits and special removal tools just so you can get back to easy Internet browsing.</p> <p>Let's look at some industry specifics.</p> <p>One of the largest Adware agencies WhenU.com of New York, distributes its software piggybacked on popular &quot;free&quot; applications downloaded from the Internet. Once on your computer, it then distributes advertisements in the form of pop-ups to your desktop as you browse the Internet. Who's to blame in this scenario, WhenU or its clients that actually pay WhenU to distribute their ads? Merck, T-Mobile, Priceline, Verizon, to name a few.</p> <p>And mortgage brokers. I would say that 50% of all the spam I receive is based around some untrue promise about an enormously low interest rate for which I qualify. Strange, most of the junk mail I get in my street mailbox is the same crap. WHO FALLS FOR THIS? It must work if the junk keeps coming and coming.</p> <p>I am not talking specifically about spam here, that is a story in itself, but I am talking about unfair marketing techniques that need to be controlled. We all see our fair share of mortgage company pop-ups, don't we?</p> <p>Give me the shotgun!</p> <p>The worst of the worst are the various toolbar distributors that promise a better Internet experience. CoolWebSearch, Hotbar, WyWebSearch, and the horrid &quot;My Search Assistant&quot; which mutates itself if you try to uninstall it. How creepy is that? Every time you uninstall the hijacker, it places itself in a different spot on your computer and renames itself, so the next time you restart your PC, it re-installs. Trust me, the longer you keep this program on your system, the worse your system gets. More and more pop-ups which lead to more spyware and adware and the resolution is horrendous.

Frankly I figured it was all a lot of overblown hype. This led to an unfortunate incident that involved my website being attacked, apparently by a skillful youth with a propensity for mischief.</p> <p>The main security flaw with my website was probably the simple fact that the username and password were exactly the same. Granted I did realize that this wasn't highly intelligent but I didn't have the power to change it myself, and I didn't think it really mattered enough to bother about it. Having an identical username and password is a massive &quot;no-no&quot; in computer security. Your username and password should not even be related along the same line of thought. A username of &quot;Dragon&quot; and a password of &quot;Fire&quot; is not a secure combination.</p> <p>For maximum security, passwords should not be cohesive words or phrases and should not be too obviously related to something like your birthday or the birthday of someone close to you. Personal information is one of the first things used when people attempt to break passwords. Having a password of &quot;Password&quot; is indeed humorous and ironic but it is not in the least bit secure.</p> <p>A &quot;brute force&quot; password hacking technique involves using certain rules and guidelines to take a guess at possible passwords and generally works through a dictionary of sorts, trying combinations of possible words and common characters. Your best bet at creating a secure password is to pick a random collection of letters, numbers, and symbols, including varying case changes (in a password the letter &quot;a&quot; is not the same as the letter &quot;A&quot;, so alternating at random between upper and lower case will increase the difficulty encountered in cracking your password). Selecting a sequence of characters on the keyboard (such as &quot;asdf&quot; or, worse, &quot;1234&quot;) definitely does not create a secure, random password.</p> <p>Having symbols in your password is an easy way to greatly increase security. These are the special characters accessed by holding the &quot;Shift&quot; key and pressing one of the numbers at the top of the keyboard. If you want to truly expand your arsenal of special characters, try holding down the &quot;alt&quot; key and pressing a combination of numbers on the num pad (the rectangular collection of numbers on the right hand side of most keyboards) then release &quot;alt&quot;. For example, holding &quot;alt&quot; and pressing numbers, 1 then 6 then 8 and releasing &quot;alt&quot; will give the character &quot;&quot;. Most combinations of 3 numbers will enter a different symbol into your password. This may make it a little harder to enter your password but it makes it a lot harder for anyone else to crack it.</p> <p>To make passwords easier to remember you can use something original, like the name of your favorite character in a book (personal information that other people won't know). Then add some numbers to it, perhaps use the &quot;Leet speak&quot; (check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet for exact definition) method of changing letters to numbers and generally mix things up so that to you it seems coherent and memorable but to an automated pattern recognizer it seems random. For example, &quot;jAm35_5m1Th&quot; (&quot;James Smith&quot;) is actually surprisingly secure. In this case the password's meaning is obvious to a human reader but it will take a lot of work for them to divine the password without prior knowledge.</p> <p>For additional security you should not use the one user name and password for every account that you have. If you do and someone manages to get hold of your details for one site they pretty much have the run of your digital life. It is not particularly vital to have perfect passwords for less important accounts (e.g. web based email from Hotmail, forums you visit etc.). These sites can quite happily be accessed using the same password. However, bank accounts, work email etc. should be made as secure as possible.</p> <p>Hopefully a few of these tips will assist you in making your online activities more secure. Keep these guidelines in mind, change your password on a semi regular basis, and with any luck you'll be able to avoid the hacking menace that befell me.</p> <h2 id="how-free-scripts-can-create-security-problems"><a href="#how-free-scripts-can-create-security-problems" class="header-anchor">#</a> How Free Scripts Can Create Security Problems</h2> <p><img src="https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&amp;quality=80&amp;size=b9999_10000&amp;sec=1592311992448&amp;di=141466a33e5f4aaa185bee75bc54a911&amp;imgtype=0&amp;src=http%3A%2F%2Fb-ssl.duitang.com%2Fuploads%2Fitem%2F201702%2F21%2F20170221101025_8AKrW.png" alt="home" title="百度logo"></p> <p>With the Internet entering our lives in such an explosive manner, it was inevitable that Internet security issues would follow as well. While credit card frauds are an offline security problem that has been carried over to the Internet as well, spamming and phishing are uniquely Internet security hazards.</p> <p>spammers are an Internet phenomenon that have been given great encouragement by the distribution of free scripts. Free scripts and free downloadable software are one of the greatest attractions of the web. Unfortunately, they are also one of the biggest security risks the Internet offers.</p> <p>spammers use free scripts to their advantage very ingenuously. Refer-a-Friend scripts are a great asset on any site. They allow visitors to recommend a site to their friends. And, by simply a Refer-a-Friend script, a Webmaster can increase traffic on his website at zero cost!</p> <p>Unfortunately, Refer-a-Friend scripts that don't have built-in security features are a popular tool with spammers as well. When your site visitor enters friends' e-mails, the insecure Refer-a-Friend scripts capture those e-mails and collates them into a spam database.</p> <p>The spammers then use the e-mails to create illegal lists and sell them for a profit or send large quantities of spam. This can result in major damage for your website from loss of consumer loyalty and trust to deactivation of your e-mail privileges by your hosting company to even disbarment from your web server.</p> <p>It thus becomes vital that any Refer-a-Friend script that you choose to install on your website must have a security feature. The scripts should limit how many people can be e-mailed at one time and how many e-mails can be sent within a limited period. It can also set a delay before the form can be used again. One of the most effective security features is to get visitors to enter a randomly generated visual code, which is not readable by spam software.

Not just one, but at least forty appeared in my popserver mailbox. As frustrating as it was deleting all of these nasty little boogers, I realized that some of these &quot;worm&quot; emails even came from persons I knew - or so I thought I knew.</p> <p>The problem with the &quot;Mydoom&quot; email worm is that it specifically targets email addresses with the following extensions:
.htm
.sht
.php
.asp
.dbx
.tbb
.adb
.pl
.wab
.txt
Furthermore, it sends &quot;get&quot; requests to target domains and uses direct connections to port 80. It will also attempt to send email messages using its own SMTP engine. The worm is successful by using a mail server that a recipient uses or local server as well. Some strings to these target Domain Names are:
gate.
ns.
relay.
mail1.
mxs.
smtp.
mail.
mx.</p> <p>The &quot;Mydoom&quot; worm will have subject headings such as:
&quot;Returned Mail&quot;
&quot;Delivery Error&quot;
&quot;Status&quot;
&quot;Server Report&quot;
&quot;Mail Transaction Failed&quot;
&quot;Mail Delivery System&quot;
&quot;Hello/hello&quot;
&quot;Hi/hi&quot;</p> <p>What persons need to realize is that even if you &quot;know&quot; the sender, you must make absolutely sure that any attachments are specifically clarified from the sender before you attempt to open these suspect emails. Most worms and viruses are spread directly through attachments. Unless you are expecting an attachment from a person you know, be cautious. Do NOT open attachments unless you are absolutely positive that your known correspondent has actually sent it to you. Another thing to remember is that the &quot;Mydoom&quot; worm ranges from 6,144 bytes to 29,184 bytes in size and can affect Windows 2000, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP. Luckily, if you have DOS, Linux, Macintosh, OS/2 or UNIX, your systems will not be affected by the MyDoom worm.</p> <p>For those of you who share files through Kazaa, there is a new worm with aliases such as Worm.P2P.Apsiv (Kaspersky) and W32/Apsiv.worm!p2p (McAfee) and seemingly affects Windows systems 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, Server 2003 and Windows XP. The damage profile has not yet been assessed, but it would be a good idea to steer clear of this one as well.</p> <p>&quot;Keylogger.Stawin&quot; is probably one of the nastiest viruses as it attempts to steal a user's online banking information. A Trojan is distributed through email messages with the subject line, &quot;I still love you,&quot; and has a &quot;message.zip&quot; attachment. Affecting the same vunerable systems as mentioned above, Keylogger records keystrokes and has the ability to steal personal, financial information. A few systems that Keylogger monitors are window titles such as &quot;PayPal,&quot; &quot;Logon,&quot; and numerous other window titles associated with banking logins.</p> <p>Common Hoaxes</p> <p>A popular hoax circulating the Internet is an email titled, &quot;FREE M &amp;M's.&quot; Sorry guys - no M &amp; M's here. More recently, you may have received the &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; virus ... er, hoax. The &quot;life is Beautiful&quot; virus is not real and should be ignored. This is only a scare tactic that causes unwarranted fears and concerns.</p> <p>In closing, the Internet is a massive electronical world filled with infinite bits of information. When using your &quot;key&quot; to this magnificent but vast window of versatile knowledge, it pays to use logic when distinguishing hoaxes from real threats such as viruses and worms.</p> <p>To learn more about current viruses and worms, visit: http://search.symantec.com/custom/us/query.html

Haven't you noticed how many new things you learned lately? We are much better informed about malicious programs than just a year ago.</p> <p>This section of our vocabularies grows rapidly: now we all know what a &quot;keylogger&quot; is,&quot;worm&quot; for us has something to do not only with zoology, nor a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; with Ancient Greek literature. We are getting better at avoiding such scams as phishing, and this word doesn't look like a spelling mistake anymore.</p> <p>We Web users are getting smarter -- at least the numbers from the recent survey by the Pew Internet and American life Project say so. The study shows that 91% of respondents (adult Web users from the USA) have improved their online behavior in one way or another.</p> <p>81% of respondents have become more cautious about e-mail attachments.</p> <p>People are also avoiding certain Web sites (48%), using file-sharing networks less often (25%), and even switching browsers (18%).</p> <p>But, alas? As Web users get wiser, cybercriminals become more insidious and commit more sophisticated crimes.</p> <p>More people are now aware of a worm, virus or Trojan which might be hidden in a spam email attachment -- for cybercriminals it means that spam becomes less &quot;effective&quot; means of spreading malware.</p> <p>Why they are spreading malware? What motivates them? Money, of course.</p> <p>All security experts are at one in thinking that &quot; cybercriminals are primarily motivated by financial gain&quot;. In other words, they prefer cash to fun. Instead of doing mischief just for the h? of it, they steal money. Big money.</p> <p>Along with other unlawful activities, cybercriminals are actively hunting for valuable data that can be turned into cash. Stealing information needs contaminating as many PCs as possible with malicious programs. Most PC users now are aware of (or we even can say, almost got used to) the fact that Trojan horses can be included into e-mail messages, multimedia files or free knick-knackery like postcards, smileys and screensavers. We users know that many viruses, worms, and Trojan horses contain information-stealing (keylogging) modules.</p> <p>Spreading malware as wide as possible that's what cyberthieves do in order to reach their treacherous goal. At least it was their main approach -- until recently, when crooks began to more intensively exploit a new tactic.</p> <p>Targeting at Individual Addressees</p> <p>On July 8, 2005 CERT (the US computer Emergency Readiness Team), issued an alert warning about the rise of Trojan attacks of a new kind. Signs of these stealthy Trojan attacks, which were targeting specific firms to evade detection, have been detected for the last year. Targeted Trojan-horse attacks are a new trend in online threats, states the alert.</p> <p>Trojan attacks by themselves aren't new, but CERT said this technique has two features that make it very dangerous, especially for Businesses.</p> <p>First, conventional anti-virus software and firewalls can't beat Trojans of this kind. These programs are &quot;tailor-made&quot;. Source code of known Trojans, if altered, is unfamiliar to anti-viruses, and they can't detect it.</p> <p>Any new variation of known malicious program is a new program for anti-viruses. There is a long way from detection of a piece of malware to the moment when an anti-virus or anti-spyware vendor is able to offer protection against it. This cycle takes time -- from several hours to a couple of days. When such a program is detected, its signature (piece of code) should be picked and included into an update. Only after all anti-virus or anti-spyware programs on all users' PCs are updated it is possible to protect them against this particular piece of malware. Poor consolation for those unlucky ones who were hit by a new kind of malware FIRST.</p> <p>These e-mails contain dangerous malware-laden attachments, or links to web sites hosting Trojan horses. When such an attachment is opened or a link is clicked, a malicious program installs the Trojan onto the users' machines. These Trojans can be configured to transmit information via ports used for a common service, like</p> <h2 id="phishing-based-scams-a-couple-of-new-ones"><a href="#phishing-based-scams-a-couple-of-new-ones" class="header-anchor">#</a> Phishing-Based Scams: A Couple of New Ones</h2> <p><img src="https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&amp;quality=80&amp;size=b9999_10000&amp;sec=1592312090686&amp;di=f7c1ca628dae25127623a5132c418440&amp;imgtype=0&amp;src=http%3A%2F%2Fb-ssl.duitang.com%2Fuploads%2Fitem%2F201508%2F22%2F20150822100049_ChWFz.jpeg" alt="home" title="百度logo"></p> <p>Phishing in its &quot;classic&quot; variant is relatively well-known. Actually, 43.4 % of adults have already been contacted by phishers, says the survey released on May, 17 by First Data Corp.</p> <p>Despite the sad fact that about 5% of phishing attempts are successful for fraudsters, PC users are getting more cautious about bogus e-mails asking for personal and/or financial information.</p> <p>As public awareness of phishing methods grows, phishers are inventing new tactics in an attempt to delude people.</p> <p>Yet Another Phishing Scheme: Don't Fax Back, Please</p> <p>On August 10, 2005 experts from SophosLabs warned us users about a new phishing trick. No bogus websites this time: phishers were trying to make people to send their credit card information? by fax.</p> <p>The emails claim to be from Paypal, the payment system used by the popular ebay auction website. They tell a user that a security breach has occurred - someone tried to reset his password. Rather clichd, isn't it? Lots of phishers follow this pattern.</p> <p>The difference is that no bogus online forms are involved. The email urges the user to download the form (Microsoft Word document), fill it and send by fax.</p> <p>The online form is hosted on a Polish server. The fields to fill in include: credit card details used in the Paypal account (name on the credit card, its number, type, expiration date), as well as email address on Paypal account with password, post address and phone numbers.</p> <p>With such a lot of personal identifying information it won't be difficult for a fraudster to pose as this person and commit a bunch of crimes, from cleaning all money from the account to setting deals under the victim's name.</p> <p>One hasn't to be a genius to guess what people this scam is aimed at. Having heard and read about bogus phishing websites, users are getting suspicious about filling forms online. They might think that faxing personal details is safer -- and make a very costly mistake. Phishers take advantage of our carelessness and credulity.</p> <p>ebay Scheme - Specially for Kind-Hearted</p> <p>This scam is even more brazen, because it exploits people's generosity and kindness. Giving a helping hand to an elderly woman - what can be more natural for any human being?</p> <p>Emails come ostensibly from Greta, a wheelchair-bound woman of 89. This lady can't find a particular auction, so she &quot;asks you for help&quot;.</p> <p>When some Good Samaritan, willing to assist her, clicks the link in the email, he or she is directed to a bogus eBay site, then, unaware of the deceit, clicks the 'respond now' button and logs on. User names and passwords, obtained this way, most likely will be used to set up deals on ebay under names of other people.</p> <p>The only way to prevent such scams is stop being credulous and careless. Don't uncritically believe everything you read about -- especially in emails from people you don't know personally.</p> <p>Don't give out your personal information before verifying where it goes to and whether the claim is genuine.</p> <p>Whatever the means of providing information -- phone, fax, snail mail or email -- if you hand out certain information, you lose it.</p> <p>Spam remains one of the favorite tools for identity thieves of all stripes. Never responding, never clicking links within fraudulent spam messages, or, even better, deleting them straight away should become a habit, like washing hands or cleaning teeth.</p> <p>Alexandra Gamanenko currently works at Raytown Corporation, LLC -- an independent software developing company.

Part 1 of 3</h2> <p><img src="https://ss1.bdstatic.com/70cFvXSh_Q1YnxGkpoWK1HF6hhy/it/u=209164587,4044588430&amp;fm=26&amp;gp=0.jpg" alt="home" title="百度logo"></p> <p>In a word, no - an email message has always been nothing more than a simple text message sent unencrypted to a recipient we choose. So all the email that we so blithely send all over the Internet everyday is neither private nor secure. Every birthday greeting or Dear John email, every complaint, rant or verbal purge we may have sent to our employers, credit companies, congressman or Customer Service rep is subject to delivery errors or outright interception.</p> <p>How can this be? To answer that we need to understand how email works. For the vast majority of email users today, the email system they use consists of two servers providing incoming and outgoing services, SMTP and POP3.</p> <p>The SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server handles the outgoing email. SMTP was designed years ago when plain ascii text was all there was to send via email. So, when you push the &quot;Send&quot; button in your email client, the SMTP server at your ISP (Internet Service Provider) connects with the incoming POP3 (Post Office Protocol ver. 3) server where you are sending the email. The servers have a short &quot;chat&quot; verifying that the email address you are trying to send to exists on the incoming POP3 server. Then the SMTP server passes the message to the POP3 server and the POP3 server puts the message into the recipient's email box. At no time during the process is your email encrypted to protect your privacy. The message could be intercepted at anytime during the process and read by anyone.</p> <p>On occasion, email sent to you or by you may even be delivered to the wrong inbox and your private message is no longer private. A single misdirected message could expose you to all kinds of trouble depending upon it's content.</p> <p>Well, no one wants to read your email right? Wrong! Have you ever heard of Carnivore? That's a system that the FBI uses to harvest all email traffic going through a network. How does this affect you? When the FBI hooks Carnivore up to your ISP's network because they suspect someone of dealing drugs or some other crime, Carnivore will filter through ALL email looking for keywords that relate to the crime in question. And because the search has to be intentionally vague, you may be sending a request for information about a prescription drug you take and Carnivore will harvest your email to be read by a human agent. Suddenly, the drugs you're taking are now public knowledge. spammers have also been known to harvest email addresses via captured emails.</p> <p>OK - so now that you know the problem, what should you do about securing your privacy? It was hinted at earlier on... encryption! Learn how to use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to encrypt your email.</p> <p>PGP uses a Public/Private key method to encrypt email. First you create a &quot;Public&quot; key. This is the key that others will use to encrypt email sent to you. Send this key to everyone you want to receive encrypted email from. Then you create a &quot;Private&quot; key. This is the key you use to decrypt any encrypted email sent to you. Safeguard this key well. It is the only thing that can decrypt your messages. If you tell someone what it is or loose it, your privacy is again compromised.</p> <p>For more information on PGP and a free download visit: http://www.pgpi.org.</p> <p>Next Time: Incorporating PGP into your email...</p> <p>Michael Ameye has been developing web sites since 1995.

No company you buy things from needs your social security number.</li></ol> <p>If you do Business on the web, obtain a a Federal Tax ID number to use instead of your social security number.</p> <p>Once criminals have your social security number, along with your birth date and address, they have virtually everything they need to start wreaking havoc in your life.</p> <ol start="2"><li>Use a good anti-virus program.

By giving a company your checking account numbers you give away much of the information necessary to empty your bank account!</p> <ol start="5"><li>Never give out information such as your birthday, marital status, education level or other personal information.</li></ol> <p>This additional information makes it extremely easy for criminals to make themselves appear legitimate when they pose as you. websites should ultimately only require you to provide your name, email and billing information for a purchase.</p> <p>You should avoid any site requiring more information than that.</p> <p>These criminals prey on people's ignorance and you can usually defeat them simply by making it too hard for them to get your information.</p> <p>If you do find yourself a victim, immediately contact police and get legal help. Do not wait because you feel embarrassed or &quot;stupid&quot; over what happened.</p> <p>Waiting only lets the trail grow cold and limits how much law enforcement can do to help you.</p> <p>(c) Jim Edwards - All Rights reserved - www.thenetreporter.com</p> <p>Jim Edwards is a syndicated newspaper columnist and the co-author of an amazing new ebook that will teach you how to use fr^e articles to quickly drive thousands of targeted visitors to your website or affiliate links...</p> <h2 id="viruses-trojans-and-spyware-oh-my"><a href="#viruses-trojans-and-spyware-oh-my" class="header-anchor">#</a> Viruses, Trojans, and Spyware - Oh My!</h2> <p><img src="https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&amp;quality=80&amp;size=b9999_10000&amp;sec=1592312338276&amp;di=c408f4a56b40665d629e4cceae415762&amp;imgtype=0&amp;src=http%3A%2F%2Fimage.namedq.com%2Fuploads%2F20200108%2F19%2F1578484294-yVTKCfLbge.jpeg" alt="home" title="百度logo"></p> <p>Have you ever had to call Symantec or McAfee to ask them how to remove a virus? Or have you spent hours online trying to figure out how to remove spyware, only to find out that you did something wrong and now your computer won't boot? I know your pain and frustration with just trying to use your computer without worry. As a computer technician at ARCH Computing Services, I know how hard it can be to pay someone to remove viruses and spyware. In fact that's how I started in the computer Business. I didn't want to pay someone to fix the problems that I usually caused. A little voice in my head told me &quot;I can build a computer, it doesn't look that hard!&quot;</p> <p>Six years later, and a lot of dead computers in the beginning, have placed me where I am now. Let me tell you, it's a full time job, even when I'm not at work. There is always some new technology being developed, and of course security is a never-ending battle with new viruses, trojans and spyware daily.</p> <p>The internet is full of how-to information. You can learn everything from how to make the perfect loaf of bread, tune your car, or remove a virus. Making a loaf of bread seems to be easy, and it probably is. Even if you end up making flat bread or burnt bread, you're not out a lot of money or in too much trouble. On the other hand, if you try to tune your car and break a spark plug or put the wires back incorrectly, it could end up costing you a lot more to fix it. All you wanted to do was save a few bucks and do it yourself. I've burnt bread and I've tried to fix my own car. The bread was thrown in the trash, the car I ended up taking to an auto mechanic and having it fixed right, which of course cost me much more than money, it cost me time.</p> <p>You must be wondering what my point is. Yes, removing a virus or building a computer isn't really that hard of a task?if you live and breathe computers like I do and others do (we affectionately call ourselves Geeks). Let's take a look at the following scenario.</p> <p>James is a real estate broker, and a damn good one. He makes his living helping people find the best buy for their dollar. As a result James keeps an extensive client list on his computer. Somewhere along the line he manages to pick up a nasty Trojan. His anti-virus software caught it but was unable to clean it. He does some research online and finds a site that explains how to remove the Trojan. After following the instructions he reboots his PC only to find that his machine will not boot. In frustration he goes to another computer and looks up information on boot problems and finds out that the best thing he can do is reformat his hard drive and re-install his operating system from his backup. Oh, by the way, he hasn't done a backup in over 6 months. By this time he has spent 4 or 5 hours trying to fix the problem, and now has the daunting task of re-installing his operating system without any backup?</p> <p>The moral of the story here is that he literally wasted hours that he could have spent making a sale or helping a client purchase a house or land. Is the above scenario a little extreme? In some ways it is, but it doesn't fall too far from the truth. Many of the clients I see with virus or spyware problems have tried everything they can to remove the problem, only to find out they spent hours with no results, and often come out worse than they were. By the time they come to see me they are frustrated and just want it fixed. Unfortunately, this does cost them money that they didn't want to spend in the first place, and more importantly in this day and age, it costs them more time. Time is the great equalizer. If James had been able to make a 10% percent commission on a $200,000 house, spending the 65 to 100 dollars to clean his computer wouldn't have seemed very significant.</p> <p>Nine times out of ten an infected computer does require a re-format and re-install. I don't say this lightly. It is usually much easier to backup and start over than spend hours trying to find every little piece of nastiness that was installed on your computer.</p> <h2 id="_3-pervasive-phishing-scams"><a href="#_3-pervasive-phishing-scams" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3 Pervasive Phishing Scams</h2> <p><img src="https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&amp;quality=80&amp;size=b9999_10000&amp;sec=1592312425023&amp;di=de7b2825f0ca2921394a59a242dc4ee3&amp;imgtype=0&amp;src=http%3A%2F%2Fimg2.imgtn.bdimg.com%2Fit%2Fu%3D3002376512%2C24872662%26fm%3D214%26gp%3D0.jpg" alt="home" title="百度logo"></p> <p>Scams involving email continue to plague consumers across America, indeed the world. These so called &quot;phishing&quot; scams involve &quot;spoofed&quot; emails meant to draw the unwary to bogus internet sites masquerading as legitimate sites. These scam artists -- phishers -- attempt to hook visitors in by having them divulge certain critical and personal bits of information. Once the information has been divulged the phishers start their dirty work and you have been conned. Several phishing scams continue to persist, the following are three of the most pervasive ones.</p> <ol><li>Financial Institutions. It is highly likely that you have already received this type of notice which appears to have come from your financial institution. It goes something like this:We are glad to inform you, that our bank has a new security system. The new updated technology will ensure the security of your payments through our bank. Hoping you understand that we are doing this for your own safety, we suggest you to update your account , this update will maintain the safety of your account. All you have to do is complete our online secured form. Thank you .</li></ol> <p>Comment: No financial institution will require you to respond to an email asking you to update your account. In addition, I left in the typos, punctuation errors, and overall poorly worded request just as it is. Finally, many of these scams do not go to account holders as the phishers spam email accounts in the hope that someone will take the bait.</p> <ol start="2"><li>Paypal Account. This scam is giving Paypal/ebay fits as its says that billing information must be updated by you, the recipient of the notice. Verbiage is included whereby &quot;Paypal&quot; threatens to close your account if you do not respond, money will be withheld, etc.</li></ol> <p>Comment: The first time I saw this note, I thought: huh?! The nerve of Paypal! However, I forwarded the letter to Paypal who confirmed its scammy nature.</p> <ol start="3"><li>ISP Fraud. An internet service provider has seen a number of &quot;their&quot; letters surface in emails around the US. A common request goes something like this: Dear Comcast customer,</li></ol> <p>We recently attempted to charge your account but we seem to receive an error when charging your card. This sometimes occurs for a variety of reasons including card expiration, over limit, suspicion of fraud, or several other technical difficulties. Please visit the Comcast Service Center, by clicking on the hyperlink shown below, and update your information so this issue can be resolved.</p> <p>Comcast Service Center</p> <p>Thank you,</p> <p>Chris Hammonds</p> <p>Comcast Service Department</p> <p>Comment: Another request to obtain valuable information belonging to you. I have seen 3-4 variations of this letter, all allegedly from Comcast.</p> <p>Oftentimes, phishers will go to great lengths to copy the company's logo and other pertinent information and include that within the email. Almost without fail they provide a link for you to click on so that you will go to a site thinking that it is legitimate.</p> <p>Once at the scam site, all kinds of questions will be asked of you including: social security number, credit card information, your address, and more. The more information you give, the easier it will be for you to become a victim of identity theft as the perpetrators assume your identity and open up multiple accounts in your name.</p> <p>Usually the consumer knows nothing of the scam until they receive letters demanding payment for accounts opened up in their name, calls from creditors, and rejected credit applications because of assumed bad credit.</p> <p>The best defense, of course, is to not respond to the email. However, you can play an important part in stopping phishing fraud by forwarding a copy of the message to the company being mimicked. Their fraud department will be grateful and you will help them [as well as policing authorities] in their quest to stop phishers in their tracks.</p> <p>Matthew Keegan is The Article Writer who writes on just about any and every issue imaginable.
